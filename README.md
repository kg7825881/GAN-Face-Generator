# GAN Face Generator with TensorFlow

This project is a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) with the WGAN-GP improvement, trained on the CelebA dataset to generate realistic, 64x64 pixel images of human faces.

## Project Overview

The model was built from scratch using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. It uses an advanced GAN architecture (WGAN-GP) to ensure stable training and produce high-quality, diverse images. The training was performed on the Kaggle platform using a P100 GPU.

## Final Results

Here are some of the best faces generated by the model after 30 epochs of training.

### Latent Space Interpolation
This visualization shows a smooth transition between two randomly generated faces, demonstrating that the model has learned a meaningful and continuous representation of facial features.
